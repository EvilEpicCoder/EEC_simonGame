### Free Code Camp Practical Task

#### 1.Project
	* Project created for improve practical skills in design and programming
	* Small story telling : I try to create very accurate "plastic design" and simulate in design the light effect from the bulbs.
#### 2. What I use in this project
	* Frameworks : jQuery, CSS3, HTML5
	* Links: [Screenshot](https://www.CHANGE_HERE "CHANGE_HERE")
		* What cool things I found: with shadows you can manage any effect what you like
		* What I do not like: time asynchronization is something awful in this project
	* Features: lights effect simulation
#### 3. My thoughts
	* Pros and Cons : cool style, bad timings.
	* Time consumption about 6 days
	* What I learned lot small things, like timing recursion function.
